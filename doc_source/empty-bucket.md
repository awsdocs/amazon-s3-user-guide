# How do I empty an S3 Bucket?<a name="empty-bucket"></a>

You can empty a bucket, which deletes all of the objects in the bucket without deleting the bucket\. When you empty a bucket with versioning enabled, all versions of all the objects in the bucket are deleted\. For more information, see [Managing Objects in a Versioning\-Enabled Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/manage-objects-versioned-bucket.html) and [Deleting/Emptying a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-or-empty-bucket.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

**To empty an S3 bucket**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the **Bucket name** list, select the option next to the name of the bucket that you want to empty and then choose **Empty**\.

1. On the **Empty bucket** page, confirm that you want to empty the bucket by entering the bucket name into the text field, and then choose **Empty**\.

1. \(Optional\) Monitor the progress of the bucket emptying process on the **Empty bucket: Status** page\.

**Warning**  
This action deletes all objects in the bucket\. Wait for the empty bucket action to finish before adding new objects\. New objects might be deleted if they are added while the empty bucket action is in progress\.
