# Deregistering delegated administrators for S3 Storage Lens<a name="storage_lens_console_organizations_deregistering_delegated_admins"></a>

You can deregister delegate administrator access to accounts in your organization\. When an account is deregistered as a delegated administrator, the account loses authorization to access all read\-only AWS Organizations APIs that provide visibility to the members and structures of your organization\.

**Note**  
 Deregistering a delegated administrator also automatically disables all organization\-level dashboards created by the delegated administrator\.
The delegate administrator accounts can still see the historic data for these disabled dashboards according to their respective retention periods\. 

**To deregister accounts for delegated administrator access**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**, **Organization settings**\.

1. In the **Accounts with delegated access** section, choose the account ID you want to deregister, and then choose **Remove**\.
