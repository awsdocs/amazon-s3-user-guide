# Deleting an Amazon S3 Storage Lens dashboard<a name="storage_lens_console_deleting"></a>

**Note**  
 Before deleting a dashboard, consider the following:  
As an alternative to deleting a dashboard, you can *disable* the dashboard so that it is available to be re\-enabled in the future\. For more information, see [Disabling an Amazon S3 Storage Lens dashboard](storage_lens_console_disabling.md)\.
Deleting the dashboard will delete all the configuration settings that are associated with it\.
 Deleting a dashboard will make all the historic metrics data unavailable\.Â This historical data is still retained until its retention period expires \(14 days or 15 months, depending on whether it is a free or advanced metrics dashboard\)\. If you want to access this data again, create a dashboard with the same name in the same home Region as the one that was deleted\.
