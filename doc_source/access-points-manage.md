**View an access point's configuration details**

1. Navigate to the access point detail page for the access point whose details you want to view, as described in [Navigating to an access point detail page](#access-points-detail-page-nav)\.

1. Under **Access point overview**, view configuration details and properties for the selected access point\.

**Use an access point to access your bucket**

1. Navigate to the access point detail page for the access point you want to use, as described in [Navigating to an access point detail page](#access-points-detail-page-nav)\.

1. Under the **Objects** tab, choose the name of an object or objects that you want to access through the access point\. On the object operation pages, the console displays a label above the name of your bucket that shows the access point that you're currently using\. While you're using the access point, you can only perform the object operations that are allowed by the access point permissions\.
**Note**  
The console view always shows all objects in the bucket\. Using an access point as described in this procedure restricts the operations you can perform on those objects, but not whether you can see that they exist in the bucket\.
The S3 Management Console doesn't support using virtual private cloud \(VPC\) access points to access bucket resources\. To access bucket resources from a VPC access point, use the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST APIs\.

**Note**  
You can't change the Block Public Access settings for an access point after the access point is created\.
