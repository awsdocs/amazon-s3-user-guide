# Introduction to Amazon S3 access points<a name="access-points"></a>

 You can use Amazon S3 access points to manage access to your S3 objects\. Amazon S3 access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as uploading and retrieving objects\. A bucket can have up to 1,000 access points attached, and each access point enforces distinct permissions and network controls to give you fine\-grained control over access to your S3 objects\. 

For more information about Amazon S3 Access Points, see [Managing Data Access with Amazon S3 Access Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-points.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

The following topics explain how to use the S3 Management Console to create, manage, and use Amazon S3 Access Points\.
